When player gets radiated the player will get sick. The more radiated the player is the more player get sick.
There are three stages of radiated:
- lightly radiated (300 RAD)
- medium radiated (1000 RAD)
- heavily radiated (2000 RAD)

if player is lightly radiated longer than a day the player will get 50% sickness
if player is medium radiated longer than a day the player get 100% sickness.
If player reach heavily radiated the player will die in a day with 100% sickness.

When lightly radiated or medium the player has everyday a chance to cure from radiation.
When player reached cured state the radiation will fall off everyday.
When player has burn damage the burn will dissapear in lightly radiated when curing.
