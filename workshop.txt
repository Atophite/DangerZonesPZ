description=There are around 20 radiated zones scattered in the map. When you are wearing a geiger teller you will know when you are in a radiated area. The geiger teller makes sound and has a visual text that says there is some radiation detected. You need Iodine and a Hazmat suit to protect yourself. Iodine protect you for 50%, the Hazmat suit protects you 100%. The Iodine can be used to remove some radiation but this can only be done every 12 hours. Iodine can always be used to protect you from radiation. Iodine has a 5 hour long duration.
