[h1] Radiated Zones [/h1]
This mod was a fun project I had in 2022. Finally I decided to finish it.
The mod is multiplayer compatible.

[h2]WARNING[/h2]
It's recommended to use this mod on a new save/character. I'm not responsible if you lose your character progress.

Navigate through a world with 20 radiated zones using your Geiger Teller, which alerts you with sounds when you enter a radiation area. Equip a Hazmat Suit for full 100% protection, or use Iodine and masks for varying levels of defense. Iodine grants partial protection with a 5-hour duration. Stay safe and adapt to the radiated challenges in this immersive mod.

There is a chance to be cured from radiation. Read below how it works.

[h2] Safe start locations: [/h2]
The following start locations are relatively safe:
Maldraugh, Riverside, Rosewood, West Point

[h2] Installation: [/h2]
The mod doesn't require any extra installation steps.
If you would like to add more or change radiated zones. You can edit the coordinates.txt file which is located in the mod folder.

[h2] If you decide to put your own coordinates remember to make a backup of your own custom coordinates file or you will lose it when you update the mod! [/h2]

You can use the following website to generate a compatible coordinate that the mod can use:

Just remember you need to have 4 different coordinates of X and Y.

[h2]Required mods[/h2]

[h3]Radiation Mechanics[/h3]
When player gets radiated the player will get sick. The more radiated the player is, the more player get sick
There are three stages of radiated:
[list]
[*]lightly radiated (300 RAD)
[*]medium radiated (1000 RAD)
[*]heavily radiated (2000 RAD)
[/list]

if player is lightly radiated the player will get 25% sickness.
if player is medium radiated the player get 50% sickness.
If player reach heavily radiated the player will die with 100% sickness.

If player has more than 300 RADS:
[list]
[*]Die Chance: 0%
[*]Cure Chance: 30%
[*]Burn Chance: 20%
[*]Radiation is Not Cured (No event occurs): 50%
[/list]
OR if rad is above 1000
[list]
[*]Die Chance: 5%
[*]Cure Chance: 10%
[*]Burn Chance: 35%
[*]Radiation is Not Cured (No event occurs): 50%
[/list]

When lightly radiated or medium the player has everyday a chance to cure from radiation.
But when medium radiated also has the chance to die.
The chance of being sick from radiated is X% this will not cure until player hit the luck of being cured.

When player reached cured state the radiation will fall off everyday.
When player reached cured state and gets into a radiated zone again the cure is gone.
