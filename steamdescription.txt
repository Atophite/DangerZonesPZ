[h1] RadiatedZones [/h1]
This mod was a fun project I had in 2022. Finally I decided to finish it.
The mod is multiplayer compatible.

It's recommended to use this mod on a new save. I'm not responsible if you lose your character progress.

The following start locations are relatively safe:
Maldraugh, Riverside, Rosewood, West Point

There are around 20 radiated zones scattered in the map. When you are wearing a geiger teller you will know when you are in a radiated area. The geiger teller makes sound and has a visual text that says there is some radiation detected. You need Iodine and a Hazmat suit to protect yourself. Iodine give you some protection, the Hazmat suit protects you 100% protection. Gas masks and other masks works too. The Iodine can be used to remove some radiation but this can only be done every 12 hours. Iodine can always be used to protect you from radiation. Iodine has a 5 hour long duration.

There is a chance to be cured from radiation. Read below how it works.

[h2] Installation: [/h2]
The mod doesn't require any extra installation steps.
If you would like to add more or change radiated zones. You can edit the coordinates.txt file which is located in the mod folder.

You can use the following website to generate a compatible coordinate that the mod can use:

Just remember you need to have 4 different coordinates of X and Y.

[/list]


[h3]Radiation Effects and Gameplay[/h3]
[list]
[*]Daily chance for radiation cure; failure has a chance to die.
[*]Introduction of burn damage when medium radiated.
[*]Iodine effectiveness heals 50 RADS.
[*]Hazmat Suit nerfed for reduced mobility due to weight and slowness (Use speedframework).
[/list]

[h3]Radiation Mechanics[/h3]
When player gets radiated the player will get sick. The more radiated the player is, the more player get sick
There are three stages of radiated:
[list]
[*]lightly radiated (300 RAD)
[*]medium radiated (1000 RAD)
[*]heavily radiated (2000 RAD)
[/list]

if player is lightly radiated the player will get 50% sickness.
if player is medium radiated the player get 75% sickness.
If player reach heavily radiated the player will die with 100% sickness.

If player has more than 300 RADS:
[list]
[*]Die Chance: 0%
[*]Cure Chance: 30%
[*]Burn Chance: 20%
[*]Radiation is Not Cured (No event occurs): 50%
[/list]
OR if rad is above 1000
[list]
[*]Die Chance: 5%
[*]Cure Chance: 10%
[*]Burn Chance: 35%
[*]Radiation is Not Cured (No event occurs): 50%
[/list]

When lightly radiated or medium the player has everyday a chance to cure from radiation.
But when medium radiated also has the chance to die.
The chance of being sick from radiated is X% this will not cure until player hit the luck of being cured.

When player reached cured state the radiation will fall off everyday.
When player reached cured state and gets into a radiated zone again the cure is gone.

[h1] Q&A [/h1]
Q: Is this mod multiplayer compatible?
A: Yes.

Q: My geiger teller is not working
A: Make sure the geiger teller is not empty. You need 4 batteries to fill up the geiger teller. If there are batteries already in it. You can remove the batteries and place new batteries. It works similar to the flashlight.

Q: I'm running so slow with the hazmat suit
A: You can disable SpeedFramework mod, to make your character faster with hazmat suit on.

Q: How does curing work?
A: Everyday you have a chance to cure. If you reached the curing state you are not sick anymore and the radiation slowly decreases.

Q: I'm wearing a hazmat suit but I'm not protected and I don't see the hazmat moodle.
A: Possibly there is a hole in your suit or the condition of the suit is 0. I might make a feature to make hazmat suits fixable.

Q: Where can I loot the hazmat, geigerteller and Iodine?
A: Hazmat can be found in any logical place, it's rare in wardrobes, can be found in medical and army area's. Geigerteller can be found in electronic stuff and Iodine can be found pretty much anywhere like bedtables, bathrooms, medical and army area's, etc.

Q: How can I mute the geiger teller sound?
A: You can by turning it off. Or right click and click on "Look at Geiger Teller" to see if there is any radiation. But be aware this option also uses battery so it can't be abused!
