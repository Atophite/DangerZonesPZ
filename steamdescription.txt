[h1] RadiatedZonesPZ[/h1]
This mod was a fun project I had in 2022. Finally I decided to finish it.
The mod is multiplayer compatible.

There are around 20 radiated zones scattered in the map. When you are wearing a geiger teller you will know when you are in a radiated area. The geiger teller makes sound and has a visual text that says there is some radiation detected. You need Iodine and a Hazmat suit to protect yourself. Iodine protect you for 50%, the Hazmat suit protects you 100%. The Iodine can be used to remove some radiation but this can only be done every 24 hours. Iodine can always be used to protect you from radiation. Iodine has a 5 hour long duration.

[h2] Installation: [/h2]
The mod doesn't require any extra installation steps.
If you would like to add more or change radiated zones. You can edit the coordinates.txt file which is located in the mod folder.

You can use the following website to generate a compatible coordinate that the mod can use:

Just remember you need to have 4 different coordinates of X and Y.

[h3]Radiation Mechanics[/h3]
When player gets radiated the player will get sick. The more radiated the player is, the more player get sick
There are three stages of radiated:
[list]
[*]lightly radiated (300 RAD)
[*]medium radiated (1000 RAD)
[*]heavily radiated (2000 RAD)
[/list]

if player is lightly radiated longer than a day the player will get 50% sickness. 
if player is medium radiated longer than a day the player get 50% sickness. 
If player reach heavily radiated the player will die in a day with 100% sickness. 

[list]
[*]Die Chance: 3%
[*]Cure Chance: 27%
[*]Burn Chance: 20%
[*]Radiation is Not Cured (No event occurs): 50%
[/list]
OR if rad is above 1000
[list]
[*]Die Chance: 10%
[*]Cure Chance: 10%
[*]Burn Chance: 30%
[*]Radiation is Not Cured (No event occurs): 50%
[/list]

When lightly radiated or medium the player has everyday a chance to cure from radiation. 
But also has the chance to die.
The chance of being sick from radiated is X% this will not cure until player hit the luck of being cured. 

When player reached cured state the radiation will fall off everyday.
